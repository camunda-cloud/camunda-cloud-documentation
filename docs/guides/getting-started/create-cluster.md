After login you'll see the console overview page. Since you haven't created a cluster, the overview will be empty.

In the upper right area click **Create New Cluster**. After you've assigned a name and created the cluster, a new entry appears in the overview:

For this Getting Started Tutorial, close the dialog box that pops up immediately after creating a new cluster.

The cluster is now being set up. During this phase, its state is _Creating_. After one or two minutes the cluster is ready for use and changes its state to _Healthy_:

After the cluster has been created, you can jump into the cluster detail page by clicking on the cluster name.
