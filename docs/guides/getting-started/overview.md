After login you'll see the console overview page. This is the central place to manage your clusters and the diagrams and forms you want to deploy to Camunda Cloud.

For your convenience we have already created a Test-Cluster for you.

You can either now get the guided tour through Camunda Cloud using the **Get Started** Button or just follow the documentation. In the latter case click on the Test-Cluster to prepare for the next step.
