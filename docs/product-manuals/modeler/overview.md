The basis for any executable process is a BPMN model that must be designed and configured. The design is used to specify the flow of a process. Thereby different events have to be configured in the model so that the workflow engine understands what is to be executed in this step.

A configuration can be the conditions in a gateway or the specification of a service task.

Camunda offers three tools for this: [Cawemo](https://cawemo.com/), the Camunda Cloud Modeler and the Zeebe Modeler. Cawemo focuses on the design phase and provides options for collaborative work on a BPMN model. The Camunda Cloud Modeler and the Zeebe Modeler support the technical parameterization of the models. It is possible to design the model in Cawemo and then continue working with the Cloud Modeler or Zeebe Modeler.

The Cloud Modeler and the Zeebe Modeler differ mainly in their environment. The Zeebe Modeler is a desktop application that can be installed and used locally. The Cloud Modeler is part of the Camunda Cloud Console and offers a seamless integration into Camunda Cloud.
