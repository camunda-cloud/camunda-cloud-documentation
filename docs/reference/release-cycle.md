### Release policy

Components of Camunda Cloud follow the [Semantic Versioning standard](https://semver.org/),
which defines a version number using the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` pattern.

- `MAJOR` version can make incompatible API changes
- `MINOR` version can add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- `PATCH` version can make backwards compatible bug fixes.

The Camunda Cloud team strives to release:
- A new minor version of the Camunda Cloud components every three months
- In between minor versions, two alpha releases (to preview the upcoming minor version)

At the time of writing, Zeebe supports the last two released minor versions with
patch releases. Patch releases are offered on a best effort basis for the
currently supported versions.
