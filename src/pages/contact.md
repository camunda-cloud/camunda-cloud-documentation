# Contact

There are various channels where you can reach us.

- We encourage everyone to participate in our **community** via the [Camunda Cloud community forum](https://forum.camunda.io/) or [Slack](https://camunda-cloud.slack.com/), where you can exchange ideas with other Zeebe and Camunda Cloud users, as well as the product developers.

- If you find a **bug**, please open an issue in this [repository](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/issues). The bugs have a default template, so please describe what doesn't work in detail.

- We also accept **feature requests** through a similar process. Please open an issue in this [repository](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/issues). The feature requests have a default template, so please describe what you'd like to see in detail.

- For **security-related issues**, please e-mail us at [this address](mailto:cloud-security@camunda.com) so we can solve the problem as quickly as possible. Do not use GitHub for security-related issues.

- **Feedback and Support** can be submitted or requested via the corresponding entry in the [Cloud Console navigation menu](../../docs/product-manuals/cloud-console/troubleshooting/feedback-and-support).
